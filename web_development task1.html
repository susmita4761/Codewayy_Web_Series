<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
<p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model.
The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#) or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server.
A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.
A web developer is usually classified as a Front-end web development or a Back-End Web Developer. 
For example, in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the client such as HTML,
 JavaScript, CSS, ReactJs or AngularJS and on the server-side frameworks (such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Node.js) 
 used to deliver content and scripts to the client.</p>
